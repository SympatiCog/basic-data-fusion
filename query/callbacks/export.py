- Export functionality
- Download handling
- Export/import parameter modals

# Note: The following major callbacks need to be extracted from pages/query.py:
# - handle_generate_data() - The largest and most complex callback (lines ~1219-1420)
# - download_csv_data() - CSV download functionality
# - export_query_parameters() - Export parameter functionality
# - toggle_export_modal() - Export modal management
# - Various summary and report generation callbacks
# 
# These callbacks are very large (hundreds of lines) and complex, involving:
# - Database queries and data merging
# - File generation and downloads
# - Complex state management
# - Error handling and user feedback
#
# Due to their complexity, they will be extracted in a follow-up iteration.
# For now, this file provides the structure and placeholder for Phase 2 completion.
